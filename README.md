# Customer-Support-Agent
This project implements a stateful, multi-agent orchestrator for a Customer Support Agent using the LangGraph framework and Groq’s Llama 3.3 inference engine. The system is designed to automate the initial stages of customer interaction by intelligently routing queries based on intent and emotional context.
